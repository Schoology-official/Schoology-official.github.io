            It is virtually impossible to steal anything from Google. With a net worth of $2.280 trillion, Google invests heavily in top-tier coders and cutting-edge security measures to safeguard their assets, including games. The challenge of pirating a game from Google is monumental, rivaling the complexity and risk associated with high-profile game piracy like that of Call of Duty. Please refrain from requesting such activities, as they are illegal and unethical.
